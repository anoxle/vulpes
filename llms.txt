## Overview

Vulpes is a free, multipurpose Discord bot with a unique feature: **it can be used anywhere on Discord**. Users can authorize it to their account via the "Install for User" option on the authorize page, enabling usage in:

- Group chats
- Servers where the bot is installed

The bot maintains 98% uptime, only going offline for updates (typically 1-2 minutes, usually 1 minute). Updates and patches are deployed regularly and quickly.

## Current Statistics
- **29 users** as of January 25, 2026 (2-3 are managers)

## Features

### Server-Specific Commands

While Vulpes can be used anywhere, two commands are server-only:

1. **`/addemoji`** - Add custom emojis to a server
   - Accepts emoji name, image upload, URL, or emoji.gg ID
   - To use emoji.gg: Go to https://emoji.gg/emoji/{emoji}, click "Add using the bot", copy the "Emoji ID" under "Slash Command"

2. **`/clone`** - Save and clone emojis across servers (useful for non-Nitro users)
   - **Save mode:** `/clone mode=save emoji=:cat_dancing:` - Saves emoji to a secret GitHub gist with heavily obfuscated user IDs and emoji IDs
   - **Add mode:** `/clone mode=add name={custom_name}` - Adds saved emoji to your server
   - **Tutorial mode:** Explains the feature
   - Obfuscated gist data is automatically removed after 25 minutes

**Note:** As of January 22, 2026, the bot does NOT include moderation commands. Basic moderation features (`/kick`, `/ban`, `/timeout`, etc.) may be added in the future, but Vulpes is not a moderation-focused bot.

## Bot History

*Note: This section is copy-pasted from README.md at github.com/anoxle/vulpes*

"Vulpes was previously a bot that had over 300-400+ users. It was taken down because of the Shapes Inc., ban that happened in early May 2025. At a user's request, we had added an AI chatbot (an "Shapes") powered by Shapes Inc.; subsequently, that platform was banned, and Discord took down thousands of bots that had Shapes, including ours. We regret adding it to this day. We tried to appeal but were denied, and on September 12, 2025, we created another Discord bot called Hades94 with the same focus of Vulpes. Aka, making commands that users can use anywhere (including DMs, Groups, etc.). and it gained 10 or so users, and in awhile we decided to rebrand Hades94 back to Vulpes and as of writing this ( Sunday, January 25, 2026 )., we currently have 29 users (2-3 are managers) that has Vulpes authorized to their Discord account."
